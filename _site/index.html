      <h2>Theâ„¢ Reading Consortium</h2>
<p>We are a group of friends who meet regularly discuss reading, typically about
programming or mathematics.</p>
<p>Anyone is welcome to join if they're interested. See below for how to get in touch!</p>
<h3>Currently Reading: Rust</h3>
<p>Right now we're working through rust-related readings.</p>
<p>For more detail, refer to the dedicated <a href="rust.html">rust-readings page</a>.</p>
<h3>Past Readings</h3>
<h4>Haskell</h4>
<p>We have previously covered Haskell; the page for that material may be found <a href="haskell.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Staying in touch</h3>
<p>All meetings will be announced on our <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/reading-consortium/">mailing
list</a> (if you're
interested, please subscribe!), and other important discussions should end up
there as well.</p>
<p>For more synchronous discussion, we hang out in the <a href="ircs://irc.wobscale.website#monads">#monads irc channel on irc.wobscale.website</a>, also available via matrix at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#monads:wobscale.chat">#monads:wobscale.chat</a>!
You're welcome to drop by whether you have specific questions or whether you just want to hang out.</p>
