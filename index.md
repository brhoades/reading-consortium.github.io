## The&trade; Reading Consortium

We are a group of friends who meet regularly discuss reading, typically about
programming or mathematics.

Anyone is welcome to join if they're interested. See below for how to get in touch!

### Currently Reading &mdash; Rust

Right now we're working through rust-related readings.

For more detail, refer to the dedicated [rust-readings page][rust-page].

### Past Readings

#### Haskell

We have previously covered Haskell; the page for that material may be found [here][haskell-page].

### Staying in touch

All meetings will be announced on our [mailing
list][mailing-list] (if you're
interested, please subscribe!), and other important discussions should end up
there as well.

For more synchronous discussion, we hang out in the [#monads irc channel on irc.wobscale.website][irc], also available via matrix at [#monads:wobscale.chat][matrix]!
You're welcome to drop by whether you have specific questions or whether you just want to hang out.
