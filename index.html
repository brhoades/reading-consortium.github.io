			<h2>The&trade; Reading Consortium</h2>
		</header>

		<p>
		We are a group of friends who meet regularly to discuss reading, typically about programming or mathematics.
		Right now, we are on hiatus, preparing to start studying Rust in June.
		Take a look at the <a href="rust.html">tentative reading schedule</a>!
		</p>

		<p>
		We have previously covered Haskell; you can also see that <a href="haskell.html">reading list</a>.
		Suggestions for future topics are appreciated!
		</p>

		<p>
		Want to read about how we run meetings or possible reading topics? You'll find all that <a href="https://md.hecke.rs/s/S1o5VE4xE">here</a>.
		If you have ideas, feel free to contribute them to that document or in our IRC channel!
		</p>
