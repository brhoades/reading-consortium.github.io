			<h2>The&trade; Reading Consortium</h2>
		</header>

		<p>
		We are a group of friends who meet regularly to discuss reading, typically about programming or mathematics.
		This group grew/is growing out of a <a href="https://web.mst.edu/~nmjxv3/cs4000/">Haskell special topics</a> course.
		After the course ended, we agreed that we wanted to keep going, albeit at a reduced pace.
		</p>

		<p>
		Right now, we are reading <a href="http://haskellbook.com">Haskell Programming from First Principles</a>.
		Take a look at the <a href="haskell.html">reading schedule</a>!
		</p>

		<p>
		A tentative <a href="https://md.hecke.rs/s/Byh5EYvQN">topic schedule</a> is available.
		We plan to cover Rust next; if you have ideas for recommended reading, we'd love to hear!
		</p>

		<p>
		Want to read about how we run meetings or possible reading topics? You'll find all that <a href="https://md.hecke.rs/s/S1o5VE4xE">here</a>.
		If you have ideas, feel free to contribute them to that document or in our IRC channel!
		</p>

		<p>
		If any of this sounds interesting, punch in your email <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_wvbnaOTTtpC4r2KvPw1d0-luP6hiLVDNh-8O-UK4pE/edit">here</a>,
		and we'll be in touch! You can expect an email in June 2019.
		</p>

		<p>
		If you have ideas, questions, or just want to chat, you can find us hanging out in
		<a href="ircs://irc.wobscale.website#monads">#monads on irc.wobscale.website</a> or
