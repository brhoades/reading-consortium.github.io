		<h2>The&trade; Reading Consortium</h2>
		<p>
		We are a group of friends who meet regularly to discuss reading, typically about programming or mathematics.
		This group grew/is growing out of a <a href="https://web.mst.edu/~nmjxv3/cs4000/">Haskell special topics</a> course.
		After the course ended, we agreed that we wanted to keep going, albeit at a reduced pace.
		</p>

		<p>
		Right now, we are on hiatus for the holidays but we plan to resume meeting at the end of January.
		</p>

		<p>
		The plan at this point is to meet biweekly or monthly to discuss material from the end of Haskell Programming from First Principles.
		You can see a tentative schedule <a href="https://md.hecke.rs/s/Byh5EYvQN">here</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
		Want to read about how we run meetings or possible reading topics? You'll find all that <a href="https://md.hecke.rs/s/S1o5VE4xE">here</a>.
		If you have ideas, feel free to contribute them to that document or in our IRC channel!
