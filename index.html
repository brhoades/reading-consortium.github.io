		<h2>The&trade; Reading Consortium</h2>
		<p>
		We are a group of friends who meet regularly to dicsuss reading, typically about programming or mathematics.
		This group grew/is growing out of a <a href="https://web.mst.edu/~nmjxv3/cs4000/">Haskell special topics</a> course.
		After the course ended, we agreed that we wanted to keep going, albeit at a reduced pace.
		</p>

		<p>
		Right now, we are on hiatus for the holidays but we plan to resume meeting at the end of January.
		</p>

		<p>
		The plan at this point is to meet biweekly or monthly to discuss material from the end of Haskell Programming from First Principles.
		<small>(We'll post a more detailed schedule exactly as soon as we know what it is.)</small>
		</p>

		<p>

		and we'll be in touch! You can expect an email in early 2019.
